Tried UCB exploration with double q-learning. It doesn't consistently find the global optimum, which is really bad for how simple the environment is. 
I think it's because I only use the UCB bonus for action selection. I don't bootstrap from it in the q-learning update. I'll try that next.
...
Still no good. The best I've gotten so far is with simple eps-greedy action selection.
